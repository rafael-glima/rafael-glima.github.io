I attended ICLR 2021 (virtually) and presented two workshop papers:

1 - "Fine-Grained ∆ê-Margin Closed-Form Stabilization of Parametric Hawkes Processes", at the RobustML Workshop @ ICLR 2021

and 

2 - "Bayesian Compressed Deep Learning for State Estimation of Unobservable Power Systems", at the Neural COmpression Workshop @ ICLR 2021

Fell free to reach out and discuss about them!

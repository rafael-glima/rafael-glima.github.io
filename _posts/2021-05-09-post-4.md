I attended ICLR 2021 (virtually) and presented two workshop papers:

1 - "[Fine-Grained ∆ê-Margin Closed-Form Stabilization of Parametric Hawkes Processes](https://sites.google.com/connect.hku.hk/robustml-2021/accepted-papers/paper-006)", at the RobustML Workshop @ ICLR 2021

and 

2 - "[Bayesian Compressed Deep Learning for State Estimation of Unobservable Power Systems](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=tbIi6KUr1hq)", at the Neural COmpression Workshop @ ICLR 2021

Fell free to reach out and discuss about them!
